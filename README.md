# Implementing DRY Principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)
Here I used Log class to store all exceptions occured in each module. <br/>
**Description about each class files:-** <br/>
TakingInputFromUser.java - Will take input from user. <br/>
Calculator.java - Will Perform operations based on user input. <br/>
Log.java - Will store information about Exceptions.
